# Installed Node modules

Tools installed with `npm install -g` â€“ for reference when I setup a new machine. Listing only top level packages (like `$ npm -g list --depth=0`), not including all dependencies.

- eslint: JavaScript linter (has Atom integration package)
- shapefile: Shapefile parser, e.g. to convert to GeoJSON (comes with command-line interface shp2json, by @mbostock)
- d3-geo-projection: geoproject, geo2svg
