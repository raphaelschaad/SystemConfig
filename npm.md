# Installed Node modules

Tools installed with `npm install -g` â€“ for reference when I setup a new machine. Listing only top level packages (like `$ npm -g list --depth=0`), not including all dependencies.

- shapefile: Shapefile parser, e.g. to convert to GeoJSON (comes with command-line interface shp2json, by @mbostock)
- d3-geo-projection: geoproject, geo2svg
- eslint: JavaScript linter (common editors have integration package)
- @starptech/prettyhtml: Opinionated HTML formatter for Angular/Vue/Svelte/pure HTML5 templates (although prettier supports HTML now)
- typescript: Statically typed strict syntactical superset to JS
- create-react-app: Good way to start building a new React single page application with no build configuration.
- @vue/cli: Standard Tooling for Vue.js Development (newest version 3.x).
- netlify-cli: Deploy and manage Netlify sites from the CLI.
